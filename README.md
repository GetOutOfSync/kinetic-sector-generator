# kinetic-sector-generator

This repo stores the development code for a sector generator, intended for use when developing ideas for science fiction role-playing games. One of the core ideas of this generator is that *most* generation options are available for users to modify as they see fit. As time goes on, documenation will be added and improved so these options make sense to the user.

## Logical Stages

 - Generate star and planetary positions (80%)
 - Generate planet surface (Need)
 - Generate life
 - Generate basic civilization
 - Generate major structures
 - Test for collapse
