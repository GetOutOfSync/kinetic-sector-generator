# kinetic-sector-generator

This repo stores the development code for a sector generator, intended for use when developing ideas for science fiction role-playing games. One of the core ideas of this generator is that *most* generation options are available for users to modify as they see fit. As time goes on, documenation will be added and improved so these options make sense to the user.

## Logical Stages

Below is a breakdown on the logical stages of what the generator should do, and in turn the general stages of development. This is a rough guide on how complete this generator is, and sometimes development will work on other parts for improvement or just general interest.

 - Generate star and planetary positions within the sector (80%)
 - Generate planet surface based on planetary conditions.
 - Generate life based on planetary conditions.
 - Simulate life on planet surface and its effects.
 - Simulate civilization during initial planetside development.
 - Simulate civilization on space stage internal to its own solar system.
 - Simulate interaction between civilizations
 - Simulate civilization on interstellar stage and its spread.
 - Develop collapse clauses for civilizations.
